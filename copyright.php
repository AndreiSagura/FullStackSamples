    <h2>Comments in Source Code</h2> 
    <p>If there ever was a perfect code, it would be the one that doesn’t need any explanations or comments. Clear and comprehensive code with minimum or no comments is far superior to messy code with tons of extra text. Сomments can never make up for bad code, even though in some cases they are necessary.</p>

    <p>Sometimes your code might require a comment, especially when it performs some specific task, or the method intention cannot be understood by its name only. In this case, write a single line and don’t go into too much detail. Also, you may come upon certain cases where some part of the method was turned off for some reason. Then you should leave a comment explaining the reason. Finally, TO-DO comments are an important part of writing good code. They can be very useful when you can’t do something immediately and need to keep it in mind for later.</p>

    <p>But we should always keep in mind that long, verbose comments are often redundant. Excessive comments are unnecessary, especially when they describe an obvious behavior of a method or function. For example, there’s no need to comment on clear and self-explanatory pieces of code. Generally, if the comments don’t bring any useful info or add any value whatsoever,  they should be deleted. And if you’re tempted to write a comment to justify or explain why you made a shady decision, don’t do it. Unfortunately, you won’t make your choice look any better.</p>
